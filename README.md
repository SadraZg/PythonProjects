I have implemented some mini Python projects.

I enjoy converting real world problems into code.

DiceRoller :

In the first page, you can choose to have one or two dices. According to your choice, the second page will have that number of dices and you can now " Roll " it.
For dices faces, I've used the equivalent unicode characters.
