I have implemented some mini Python projects from scratch.

I enjoy converting real world problems into code.

-----------------------------------------------------

DiceRoller:
--
In the first page, you can choose to have one or two dices. According to your choice, the second page will have that number of dices and you can now " Roll " it.
For dices faces, I've used the equivalent unicode characters.



AgeCalculator:
--
In the main page, you can enter your day, month, and year of birth. The algorithm will then calculate the elapsed years, months, days, and seconds of your life. The output will be represented as a table. 



LengthConverter:
--

There are three different length scales to choose from: Meter, Inch, Foot

In the main page, enter the value, select scales and BOOM you've got your converted value.


LinkedList:
--
Implemented linked list in Python from scratch. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), insert_first(), delete_first(), reverse(), and print_list() functions. 


Stack:
--
Implemented Stack using my LinkedList module in Python. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), push(), pop(), and print_stack() functions. 
I've implemented the stack using Python built-in functions as well.
