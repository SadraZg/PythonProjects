I have implemented some mini Python projects from scratch.

I enjoy converting real world problems into code.

-----------------------------------------------------

DiceRoller:
--
In the first page, you can choose to have one or two dices. According to your choice, the second page will have that number of dices and you can now " Roll " it.
For dices faces, I've used the equivalent unicode characters.



AgeCalculator:
--
In the main page, you can enter your day, month, and year of birth. The algorithm will then calculate the elapsed years, months, days, and seconds of your life. The output will be represented as a table. 



LengthConverter:
--

There are three different length scales to choose from: Meter, Inch, Foot

In the main page, enter the value, select scales and BOOM you've got your converted value.


LinkedList:
--
Implemented linked list in Python from scratch. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), insert_first(), delete_first(), reverse(), and print_list() functions. 


Stack:
--
Implemented Stack using my LinkedList module in Python. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), push(), pop(), and print_stack() functions. 
I've implemented the stack using Python built-in list as well.


Queue:
--
Implemented Queue using my LinkedList module in Python. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), enqueue(), dequeue(), and print_queue() functions. 
I've implemented the queue using Python built-in list as well.


DoubleLinkedList:
--
DoublelinkedList is actually bidirectional Linked List which I've implemented using my LinkedList module in Python. Currently, the class contains is_empty(), delete_first(), insert_first(), and print_list() functions.


NearestSmallerNeighbor
--
Implemented the solution to < Nearest Smaller Neighbor to Left > problem in Python using my own implementation of stack.
The time complexity would be O(n) - n being the number of elements.


BracketBalancing
--
Implemented the solution to < Bracket Balancing > problem in Python using my own implementation of stack.
The time complexity would be O(n) - n being the number of elements.


BaseChanger
--
Implemented a python module from scratch (without the use of any libraries) that changes decimal to any base and vice versa.


Graph_raw
--
This module is scratch implementation of common tasks dealing with graphs.
the tasks contain: 

- Draw the graph
- Get the incidence Matrix
- Check if the graph is connected 
- Check if the graph is tree 
- Calculate the degree of wach node in the graph
- Find the highest-degree node
- Find minimum spanning tree 
- Find the shortest path between two nodes
- Check if the graph is bipartite
- Color the graph 

[NOTE] All component are implemented without the use of any libraries, except for the drawing of the graph (NetworkX)
